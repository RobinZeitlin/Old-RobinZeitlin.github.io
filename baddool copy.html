                            <p>Baddool is a project I started because I wanted to push myself and learn new things. I together with 2 other people after going to the 2023 Swedish Game Conference decided to not wait for the opportunity to come to us and instead make it happen ourselves. Which is why even though it had not been more than 2 months since the start of FutureGames. We dove head first into making a steam title. </p>
                            <p>We set a limit for ourselves of 3 months to complete our first published title and as soon as we set foot in Future Games again we started making the game. After a couple of weeks we recruited some more people into the project and I took the role as Gameplay Programmer and Project Lead in the project.</p>

                                <h2 class="oswald-font">Day 1</h2>
                                <p class="oswald-font">Yesterday I had a strange dream. In this dream, fish swirled around me and it was my job to photograph them. I have just finished my AI course at future games and just published my first steam game. So I am ready to take on something new and exciting. Today I spent time on the basics of the project. I set up the Behaviour Tree, Three of the actions, simple Movement and also due to my previous experience with procedural generation also a procedurally generated ocean floor. I wanna make this AI as scalable and modular as possible.</p>

                                <h2 class="oswald-font">Day 2</h2>
                                <p class="oswald-font">Today I spent a lot of time working on setting up the dev diary and adding coding snippet support for my portfolio. I began adding the eating action. I spent a lot of time figuring out how to make it as modular as possible and came up with a good solution of using enums to set the preferred food of the animal and then also using another set of enums on the “Food/Algae” gameobject that I can compare with the other enum to see if they are compatible (See picture below).</p>
                                <div class="text-image">
                                    <img src="images/Caviar/Day2.png">

                                <h2 class="oswald-font">Day 3</h2>
                                <p class="oswald-font">I spent a lot of time developing something I think is extremely exciting and a little bit over engineered today. I store object types in enum variables and then compare those with a hash-table. Using the enums as keys lets me grab the correct contains meshes and materials easily. I then also added a button to the inspector to call the function if pressed. </p>
                                <p class="oswald-font">The point of me making the system this way is that instead of having 20 prefabs of every food type, I will instead be able to simply spawn the same prefab for every type of food and then just change the enum on the script on the GameObject.</p>

                                <p class="oswald-font">Today was a good day, I decided to buy the asset pack and the steam page is now completely up and running. I implemented the movement system today. The acceleration and de-aceleration is decided by animation curves so that I later can just go and tweak it when the time is given.  </p>
                                <p class="oswald-font">I also started implementing the Camera system today. It takes a picture of the screen and then overlays the pictures to fit the polaroid format.</p>
                                <div class="text-image">
                                    <img src="images/Caviar/Day4.png">

                                <h2 class="oswald-font">Day 5</h2>
                                <p class="oswald-font"> The Camera system is now basically fully implemented I added a stamp to the polaroid to market the game by just having people sharing their cute photos. (See picture below)</p>
                                <p class="oswald-font"> I also finished up the mailbox, settup the interactable system and started implementing the bubbling photos mechanic. Which means the mailbox now get spawned at the center of the map, and if you interact with it while carrying a photo, the photo gets sendt of inside of a bubble.
                                <div class="text-image">

                                <h2 class="oswald-font">Day 6</h2>
                                <p class="oswald-font"> Today was very rewarding, registering what is photographed now works by boxcasting forward, I chose this because using a raycast would cast the player to be forced to be extremely precise when trying to take photos of fish.</p>
                                <p class="oswald-font"> I also connected the level up system to this new registering what is photographed system which means I can now succesfully take a photograph of the target thing and make the ecosystem evolve! I also started working on the pause as I dont want it to be postponed and made on the last day before release.</p>

                                <h2 class="oswald-font">Day 7</h2>
                                <p class="oswald-font"> I finished up the pause menu today, implementing all its functionallity and splitting up a "bobbing" script into a component to be used else where if needed. I also added a juicyness component that when "OnEnable" triggers Invokes a unity event and scales the object to the correct size from zero causing the appearance to be smoother and more "naturul".</p>
                                <p class="oswald-font"> I also finally started working on boids. Its extremely interesting and learning how to utilize "Weights" in this case the Cohesion, Seperation and Alignment feels very rewarding. To read more about this please refer to my "Boids" walk-through.</p>

                                <p class="oswald-font">I finally was able to restrict the players movement area by clamping the poisiton of the player within a sphere. I also spent some time and made a ascript that dynamically places fences based on how big this area is as seen below.</p>

                                <p class="oswald-font">Finally GP is finished and I have time to work on my game! I spent this wonderfull friday making the game controller compatible, luckily because I was using the "new" Input system the process of converting the controlls was fairly quick and easy. One problem that i was faced with was how the player would know how to play the game with the controller. Therefore I spent the rest of the afternoon working on a system that changes a sprite basd on the type of input currently connected (as seen below in screenshots). </p>

                                <p class="oswald-font">I am very pleased with this system as it lets me easily add and change sprites for the input types in the inspector. And because I wanted this system to be reusable I also spent some time making a small editor script that makes the inspector more readable and the component easier to use.</p>

                              <p>Tldr: Using “Random Walk Algorithm” to create a procedural dungeon. Solving the problem of intercepting walls by removing them based on neighboring entities on instantiation.</p>
                              <h3 style="color: #fabf66;">How it works</h3>
                              <p> Using the “Random Walk Algorithm“. This is an algorithm that sends out “Agents” towards different rotations, storing them in a list of slots, and then use these walking paths as the slots to Instantiate entities. To get these directions I created a function that randomizes between the 4 rotation possibilities (up, down, left, right) and returns the proper Vector direction.</p>
